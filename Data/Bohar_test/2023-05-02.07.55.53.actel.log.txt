Function: explore()

M: Importing data. This process may take a while.
Warning: Long group names detected. To improve graphic rendering, consider keeping group names under six characters.
M: Number of target tags: 66.
Warning: Long array names detected. To improve graphic rendering, consider keeping array names under six characters.
Warning: The spatial input does not contain a 'Section' column. This input is only valid for explore() analyses.
Warning: Release sites were not specified in the spatial.csv file. Attempting to assume all released animals start at the top level array.
M: Matching detections with deployment periods.
M: Number of ALS: 25 (of which 17 had no detections)
Warning: No detections were found for receiver(s) 123723, 125446, 125515, 126283, 126439, 126441, 126442, 126444, 126445, 134611, 138922, 138923, 138924, 138925, 487131, 487133, 487135.
M: Data time range: 2022-11-04 05:23:00 to 2022-11-26 03:56:00 (Pacific/Guam).
M: Data successfully imported!
M: Creating movement records for the valid tags.
M: Checking movement events quality.
Warning: 'speed.warning'/'speed.error' were not set, skipping speed checks.
Warning: 'inactive.warning'/'inactive.error' were not set, skipping inactivity checks.
Warning: Tag NA-14010 (1/1) jumped through 2 arrays from release to first valid event (Release -> Mutiaur).
Warning: Tag NA-14010 (1/1) jumped through 2 arrays in valid events 13 -> 14 (Mutiaur -> Movement_South).
Warning: Tag NA-14010 (1/1) jumped through 2 arrays in valid events 16 -> 17 (Movement_South -> Mutiaur).
Warning: Tag NA-14010 (1/1) jumped through 2 arrays in valid events 19 -> 20 (Mutiaur -> Movement_South).
Warning: Tag NA-14010 (1/1) jumped 2 or more arrays on 8 occasions (of which the first 4 are displayed above).
         Events that raised warnings: 1, 14, 17, 20, 51, 53, 66, 68
M: Filtering valid array movements.
M: Compiling circular times.
M: Saving results as 'actel_explore_results.RData'.
